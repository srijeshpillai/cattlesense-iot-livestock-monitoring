\## Raspberry Pi Aggregator Code



This directory is intended for the Python code that runs on the Raspberry Pi Model 4B, which acts as the central aggregator in the CattleSense system.



\*\*Key responsibilities of this code would include:\*\*

\*   Receiving sensor data from multiple Arduino nodes via a wireless receiver (e.g., NRF24L01).

\*   Reading data from directly connected components like the RFID Card Reader.

\*   Processing and fusing the incoming data streams.

\*   Serving the web-based dashboard (using a framework like Flask or Dash).

\*   Pushing data to a cloud database for further analysis and long-term storage.
